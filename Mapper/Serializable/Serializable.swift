     Note (Anderthan): This is the set of all mapping rules.  Perhaps I should name it deserializationMappingRules to avoid confusion when we support both serialization and deserialization.
     
     The whole point of having a set of rules is that sometimes we want some sort of custom behavior on our JSON object before converting it to the class.  Some of the most common rules are mapping different keypaths.  Other things might be converting to a specific enum, or running some sort of function on it.
     
     Each rule is meant to be flexible.  A rule will take an object, and a key, and spit out the value that we wil use to store in our object.
